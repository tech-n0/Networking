# **What is an Access Point?**

An **Access Point (AP)** is a device that creates a **wireless local area network (WLAN)**, typically in an office or large building. It connects to a wired router, switch, or hub via an Ethernet cable and projects a Wi-Fi signal to a designated area. Access points are crucial in expanding the reach of a network, allowing multiple devices to connect wirelessly.

### **How Does an Access Point Work?**

An access point connects to the router or switch via a wired connection and then broadcasts a wireless signal to allow wireless devices to connect to the network. When a wireless device connects to the access point, it effectively becomes part of the local area network, gaining access to the networkâ€™s resources and the internet.

### **Benefits of Using Access Points**

- **Increased Coverage**: Access points can extend the reach of the network to cover larger areas or multiple floors.
- **Scalability**: Easy to add additional access points to expand the network as needed.
- **Flexibility**: Devices can connect wirelessly, increasing mobility and reducing the need for cables.
- **High Capacity**: Support multiple simultaneous connections, ideal for environments with high user density
### **Access Point vs. Router**

- **Access Point**: Extends the reach of an existing network and connects devices wirelessly to a wired network.
- **Router**: Directs traffic between different networks and often includes built-in access point functionality for home networks
